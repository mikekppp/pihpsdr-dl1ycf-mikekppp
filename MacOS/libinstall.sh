# HOMEBREW/POTHOSWARE PROBLEM:
#
# Some SoapySDR modules cannot be compiled using the lastest
# version (4) of CMAKE unless the option
#
# -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
#
# is given during compilation.
# To enable compilation of these modules, the file
# (Homebrew)/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/formula.rb needs
# modification. Here, (Homebrew) is /usr/local/homebrew on
# Intel Macs and /opt/homebrew on AppleSilicon Macs.
#
# Locate the following spot (the last line has been added):
#
#       # Ensure CMake is using the same SDK we are using.
#       args << "-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=#{MacOS.sdk_for_formula(self).path}" if MacOS.sdk_root_needed?
#       args << "-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5"
#
# so the required option is added to the "standard cmake args"
# Note this change is lost whenever you update/upgrade homebrew.
#
# You can apply the above fix and simply re-run this script,
# since HOMEBREW will not be re-installed if already present.
